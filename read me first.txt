1. init your project first with react-native init ProjectName --version 0.58.6
2. Add yarn to your system from https://yarnpkg.com (this is fast then npm and is more error free than npm)
3. After successful creation of your project copy all content from this directory and paste into your project folder and replace package name in package.json from your newly created package.json
4. Remove previously created locked file of package.json and on terminal/CMD run yarn install
5. Finally react-native link so that all the packages will add to the project (You can replace package or can add your's also)
